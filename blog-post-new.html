            <h4><strong>What is the Pokemon 151 Challenge?</strong></h4>
            <p>Earlier in the year, I put together some rules for a 
              narrative-driven challenge of Pokemon Gold… 
              the 151 Challenge! I wanted to breathe new life into 
              the game without making it too difficult. 
              The Nuzlocke challenge is popular, but I’m not really 
              interested in that. I prefer to keep my Pokemon, 
              build a consistent team and have more freedom 
              when catching new Pokemon in the wild. 
              There are also Type-only playthroughs on YouTube, 
              which I would be more interested in trying out at some point. 
              Instead, I decided to challenge myself to play 
              through the game by battling with only Gen 1 Pokemon.</p>

              <p>There are some basic rules, which you can find 
                on my playthrough videos on YouTube. 
                For example, early in the game you must 
                catch a proxy Gen 1 starter Pokemon to replace your Gen 2 starter. 
                The real challenge is the Elite Four because 
                you are limited in terms of being able to fully evolve your Gen 1 Pokemon 
                (evolution stones aren’t available and trade-only 
                evolutions won't work if you're using an emulator). 
                Apart from that, the rest of the game is straightforward. 
                The challenge makes you think about the 
                map in a different way. You learn more about each Route and 
                other areas that would normally be overlooked, 
                which is great. It's really designed 
                to tap into that 90's nostalgia for the original 151 generation.</p>

                <h4><strong>Okay, but will it work in Gen 3?</strong></h4>
                <p><i>Yes and no.</i> Can you play through every gym 
                  and become the champion in Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire 
                  with only Gen 1 Pokemon? It doesn’t seem possible. 
                  In Pokemon Emerald, 
                  <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Hoenn_Route_116" class="link-body-emphasis">Abra can be caught in the 
                    wild</a> before taking on the first gym leader in Rustboro City. 
                  Unfortunately, Abra won’t be able to deal any damage
                  until it evolves into Kadabra at Level 16. 
                  This means that you would need to grind with 
                  your Gen 3 starter a lot before you could 
                  use your proxy. Technically, I guess it is possible in Emerald. 
                  However, for the challenge to work as intended, 
                  the player’s Gen 3 starter would need to be 
                  swapped out as soon as their Gen 1 proxy is caught, 
                  as per the original rules.</p>

                  <p>As I’ll be playing Pokemon Ruby, here’s how it could work… 
                    You will need to defeat Roxanne with your Gen 3 starter. 
                    There’s no way around it. To gain access to Dewford Town, 
                    you will need to do that. 
                    Once you do reach Dewford Town, 
                    <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dewford_Town" class="link-body-emphasis">you can catch a variety of Gen 1 Pokemon</a>. 
                    In Granite Cave, you can 
                    find Zubat, Abra or Geodude in the wild. By fishing, you may also encounter 
                    Tentacool, Magikarp or Goldeen (if you backtrack a little). It’s 
                    important to remember to catch a Pokemon that you can battle 
                    with straight away. You will need to store your Gen 3 starter 
                    in the PC once you catch your proxy. 
                    From there, the Heonn region is yours to explore! 
                    I will draft rules more formally soon. 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCQF-WPeePo" class="link-body-emphasis">I’m still trying to defeat the 
                    Elite Four in Pokemon Gold with my team of Gen 1 Pokemon.</a>.
                    Be sure to check that out in the meantime.</p>
