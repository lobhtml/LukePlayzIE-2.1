# LukePlayzIE website - Bootstrap build 2.1

## v2.1 - 20-05-2025

- Website rebuild from previous Bootstrap versions, reconstructed using more Bootstrap shorthand. Most inline HTML styling removed
- Inline HTML styling retained to define custom margins - Bootstrap shorthand margins (m-4, for example) are useful but incremental
- HTML syntax tidied and organised. <main> tag added to better define main page content
- To ensure correct spacing on mobile "mb-3 mb-md-0" added to the second last image of the Channel art page gallery. This retains the margin-bottom for the second last image on mobile (one column) and removes the margin-bottom for that image on larger screens (two columns)
- License updated to GNU to ensure code remains open source
